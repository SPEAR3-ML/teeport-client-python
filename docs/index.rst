Teeport Client for Python
=========================

The Teeport client for python connects optimization related functions (`optimize`, `evaluate` or `process` function) written in python to the Teeport backend service. Through the minimal APIs provided by this package, your functions will be able to talk to the other functions written in other languages/require specific resources/have physical restrictions, to complete the optimization process.
